# I18n
We use `vue-i18n` as the I18n framework. All UI localization strings are stored in `infrastructure/i18n/language_id.json` files. The `langauge_id` is the language id such as `en` for english for `zh_cn` for chinese simplified.

## 1. Setup I18n
In `main.ts`, the first statement after imports is `setLocales(Vue)` that executes the function in `infrastructure/i18n/index.ts` to setup locales. It calls `Vue.use(VueI18n)` to initialize Vue with i18n methods and loads localized json files. It then calls `Vue.locale()` to set all local strings. These strings are predefined for UI elements.

Calling `Vue.use(VueI18n)` adds some i18n methods to Vue instances. A special one is `$t` method that use the current Vue `lang` variable to generate the appropriate localized string.

We also need to handle dynamic localized strings retrieved from a backend server. The localized string has a format of `{'language_id1': 'localized_value1', 'language_id2': 'localized_value2' }`. To handle this type of localized string, we customize the standard `$t()` method. If this is an ojbect, we use the passed in object to get localized value. Otherwise, it's a standard UI string, call the standard `$t()` method.

## 2. Use I18n
When develop a component, put all UI strings into the corresponding localized json files.

For both localized UI strings or dynamic localized string retrieved from a backend server, just `$t()` method to display text.
